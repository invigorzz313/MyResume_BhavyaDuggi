## What experience and knowledge/skills do you have that are applicable to this program?

My prior experience in open-source sets me apart as an applicant to this program. I have been engaged with the Girlscript Summer of Code program in 2023 as a contributor and 2024 as a mentor. The knowledge and skills I have developed so far in communication, collaboration and technical expertise in coding and documentation will help me better improve my performance in this mentorship opportunity.

I am genuinely passionate for learning and expanding my skillset. I am intrigued by the potential of Blockchain technology such as improving transparency in supply chains, enhancing financial inclusion, or enhancing new forms of digital identity and I am eager to contribute to projects that have a meaningful impact on society.
